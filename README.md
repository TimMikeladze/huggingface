# ü§ó Hugging Face Inference API

A Typescript powered wrapper for the Hugging Face Inference API. Learn more about the Inference API at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).

## Install

```console
npm install huggingface

yarn add huggingface

pnpm add huggingface
```

## Usage

‚ùó**Important note:** Using an API key is optional to get started (simply provide a random string), however you will be rate limited eventually. Join [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) and then visit [access tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) to generate your API key.

### Basic examples

```typescript
import HuggingFace from 'huggingface'

const hf = new HuggingFace('your api key')

await hf.fillMask({
  model: 'bert-base-uncased',
  inputs: '[MASK] world!'
